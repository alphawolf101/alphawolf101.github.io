##Application Development Tutorial

###Git Basics
[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a version control system for software development.

There are two ways to manage versions using Git.  Either through a series of commits or through the use of branches.

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the version control of Git using commit and revert to a previous commit.


>**Prerequisite:**

>You are **required** to do the [Creating a Web Application using Gradle Tutorial](/gradle-web-application).

>- The sample code used in the current tutorial is based from the sample code used in [Creating a Web Application using Gradle Tutorial](/gradle-web-application). 

>You are not required (but **recommended**) to do  the [Bluemix Basics Tutorial](/bluemix-basics).

>- **However**, ensure that you have a Bluemix account.  
>- Your account should have the space `dev` under the region `US-South`.  The creation of the space `dev` is discussed in [Bluemix Basics Tutorial](/bluemix-basics).

>XXXYou are not required (but **recommended**) to do  the [Bluemix DevOps Services Basics Tutorial](/devops-basics).

>- **However**, ensure that you have a Bluemix DevOps Services account.

>XXXYou are not required (but **recommended**) to do  the [GitHub Basics Tutorial](/github-basics).

>- **However**, ensure that you have a GitHub account.

####Install a Git Client


1. Go to [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

1. Download the Git client installer and install.

1. Test if the Git client is installed successfully.  Open a terminal window.

	```text
	> git
	```
	**Output:**

	```text
	usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
	           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
	           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
	           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
	           <command> [<args>]
	
	The most commonly used git commands are:
	   add        Add file contents to the index
	   bisect     Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug
	   :
	   :
	```

	You should see the help screen of the Git client.

	<br>
	
####Create several text files and use Git to manage the versions of the files

In this tutorial, you will be creating several `.txt` files that will contain a list of words representing each letter of the alphabet.  The use of this approach will help you understand how Git works.  Once you are familiar with Git, you may use Git with your source code (e.g., `.java` file).

1. Create the directory `gittemp` in the root directory.  Go to the created directory.

	```text
	> mkdir gittemp
	> cd gittemp
	```

1. Create the subdirectory `alphabet` in the `gittemp` directory.  Go to the created directory.

	```text
	> mkdir alphabet
	> cd alphabet
	```

	The `alphabet` directory represents a working directory containing your source code.  As mentioned earlier, instead of source code, text files will be used in this tutorial.

	<br>
	
1. Make the `alphabet` directory a local Git repository.

	```text
	> git init
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	Initialized empty Git repository in /gittemp/alphabet/.git/
	```

	A hidden directory named `.git` is created after you issued the `git init` command.  You should not modify the contents of the `.git` hidden directory.  This contains information that will track the changes you made inside the `alphabet` directory.

	<br>


1. Check the status of your local Git repository.

	```text
	> git status
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	On branch master
	
	Initial commit
	
	nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
	```

	As stated in the status, there is `nothing to commit`.  This will change once you start creating files.

	<br>
	
1. Create a file `animal.txt` in the `alphabet` directory with the following contents:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	dog
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	```

	<br>
	
1. Check the status of your local Git repository.

	```text
	> git status
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	On branch master
	
	Initial commit
	
	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	
	        animal.txt
	
	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
	```

	Git detected the `animal.txt` file that you created.  However, it is currently untracked by Git.  Untracked files are those in the working directory but are NOT in index.

	Git does not track all the files you created since it is possible that some of the files are non-essential.  You need to explicitly tell Git to track a file.

	<br>
	
1. Let Git track `animal.txt`.

	```text
	> git add animal.txt
	```

	>If there are multiple files that you want Git to track, you may use the same `git add` command and just separate the files with a `space`.

	The `git add animal.txt` command places the `animal.txt` in the index.  Those files in the index are staged. Staging means that a file is being prepared to be committed. 

	<br>
	
1. Check the status of your local Git repository.

	```text
	> git status
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	On branch master
	
	Initial commit
	
	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	
	        new file:   animal.txt
	```

	At this point, `animal.txt` is already in index and being tracked by Git.  However, changes made in `animal.txt` is not yet committed.

	<br>

1. Commit the changes made in `animal.txt`.

	```text
	> git commit -m "added words from ant to horse"
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	[master (root-commit) 828389d] added words from ant to horse
	 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
	 create mode 100644 animal.txt
	```
	
	Note that if there are other files that are staged aside from `animal.txt`, the changes made in those files will also be committed.

	<br>
	
1. Check the status of your local Git repository.

	```text
	> git status
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working directory clean
	```

	At this point,  changes made in `animal.txt` are committed.  In the `git commit` command, you included a message `added words from ant to horse` to give a short description on what changes were committed.  This is very useful when you perform several commits later and you want to undo previous commits.

	<br>

1. Visually look at the the details regarding the commit you performed.

	```text
	> gitk
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	*master added words from ant to horse
	```	

	`gitk` is a tool which allows you to visualize the commits you performed.  You may use `gitk` as a guide when you need to undo previous commits.
	
	<br>

1. Update `animal.txt` to include words `iguana` to `pig`:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	dog
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	iguana
	jaguar
	kangaroo
	lion
	monkey
	newt
	octopus
	pig
	```

	<br>
	
1. Track and commit the changes made in `animal.txt`.

	```text
	> git add animal.txt
	> git commit -m "added words from iguana to pig"
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	[master 5394740] added words from iguana to pig
	 1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
	```	
	
	<br>

1. Update `animal.txt` to include words `quail` to `zebra`.  In addition, delete `dog` and change `monkey` to `mouse`:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	iguana
	jaguar
	kangaroo
	lion
	mouse
	newt
	octopus
	pig
	quail
	rabbit
	snail
	tiger
	uakari
	vulture
	wolf
	x-ray tetra
	yak
	zebra
	```

	<br>
	
1. Track and commit the changes made in `animal.txt`.

	```text
	> git add animal.txt
	> git commit -m "added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse"
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	[master f1fbe3c] added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse
	 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
	```	
	
	<br>




####Checkout Previous Commits

Checking out previous commits allows you to inspect the state of the files after a particular commit.  This is done by changing back the contents of the working directory.  However, the latest committed changes remain intact.

1. Get a summary of the commits performed in the local Git repository.

	```text
	> git log
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	commit f1fbe3cfccfa0343f0b4ffe0d9c35967174b5f77
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>

	commit 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>
	Date:   Sun Jan 10 23:29:40 2016 +0800
	
	    added words from ant to horse
	```

	>**NOTE**: You may press `Q` to exit the log console.

	Notice that the three commits performed earlier are listed in the log.  In addition, there are unique hash values identifying each commit.  As an example, in the log above, the commit `added words from ant to horse` has a hash value of `828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5`.  Note that the hash value in your repository is not necessarily the same as the one shown in this tutorial.

	The hash value is important to undo previous commits and go to a particular state of a file.

1. Inspect the state of the file when the words ant to horse has just been added.

	```text
	> git checkout <hash of commit for "added words from ant to horse">
	```

	**Example:**

	```text
	> git checkout 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	```


	**Output:**

	```text
	Note: checking out '828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5'.

	You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
	changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
	state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
	
	If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
	do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
	
	  git checkout -b new_branch_name
	
	HEAD is now at 828389d... added words from ant to horse
	```

	<br>
	
1. Open (or reload) `animal.txt`and verify that its content is now the following:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	dog
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	```

	As expected,  you went back to the state  when the words ant to horse has just been added to `animal.txt`.
	
	<br>
	
1. Check the contents of the log.

	```text
	> git log
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	commit 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>
	Date:   Sun Jan 10 23:29:40 2016 +0800
	
	    added words from ant to horse
	```

	Notice that the log has only one commit.

	<br>



1. Go back to the last commit you made (i.e., `added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse`).

	```text
	> git checkout master
	```


	**Output:**

	```text
	Previous HEAD position was 828389d... added words from ant to horse
	Switched to branch 'master'
	```

	<br>
	
1. Open (or reload) `animal.txt`and verify that its content is now the following:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	iguana
	jaguar
	kangaroo
	lion
	mouse
	newt
	octopus
	pig
	quail
	rabbit
	snail
	tiger
	uakari
	vulture
	wolf
	x-ray tetra
	yak
	zebra
	```

	As expected, you are able to return to the latest state of the file.

	<br>


####Go back to a particular Commit

The `git checkout` command that was demonstrated above allows you to inspect the state of a file of a particular commit.  However, the latest committed changes remain intact.  In the event that you really want to go back to a particular commit (e.g., you realized that you erroneously changed the contents of a file and want to go back to its correct state), you may use the `git reset` command.

1. Get a summary of the commits performed in the local Git repository.

	```text
	> git log
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	commit f1fbe3cfccfa0343f0b4ffe0d9c35967174b5f77
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>

	commit 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>
	Date:   Sun Jan 10 23:29:40 2016 +0800
	
	    added words from ant to horse
	```

	This is the same log that was shown in the previous steps.

1. Go back to the state of the file when the words ant to horse has just been added.

	```text
	> git reset --hard <hash of commit for "added words from ant to horse">
	```

	**Example:**

	```text
	> git reset --hard 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	```


	**Output:**

	```text
	HEAD is now at 828389d added words from ant to horse
	```

	<br>
	
1. Open (or reload) `animal.txt`and verify that its content is now the following:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	dog
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	```

	Similar to `git checkout`,  you are able to go back to the state   when the words ant to horse has just been added to `animal.txt` using `git reset`.  You will see later the difference of these two commands.
	
	<br>
	
1. Check the contents of the log.

	```text
	> git log
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	commit 828389d84eedf01b1ca4fa842c879139bc8e62b5
	Author: Alexis V. Pantola <pantolav@gmail.com>
	Date:   Sun Jan 10 23:29:40 2016 +0800
	
	    added words from ant to horse
	```

	<br>



1. **TRY** to go back to the last commit you made (i.e., `added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse`).

	```text
	> git checkout master
	```

	**Output:**

	```text
	Already on 'master'
	```
	Notice that the output is `Already on 'master'`.  This means that you have reset the last commit from `added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse` to `added words from ant to horse`.   The `added words from quail to zebra, deleted dog, and changed monkey to mouse`commit as well as the `added words from iguana to pig` commit are already removed.
	
	<br>
	
1. Open (or reload) `animal.txt`and verify that its content is **STILL** ant to horse:

	```text
	ant
	bat
	cat
	dog
	eagle
	fox
	goat
	horse
	```

	<br>
